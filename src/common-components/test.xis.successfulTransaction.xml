<!--
    XIS test to successfully handle a transaction operation, to be added to `TestScript.test`.
    It is expected that the "patient-token-id" variable is set.
    
    During the operation, the `Prefer` header is set to `return=representation` so that the server returns the
    persisted resources in its response. This is needed to perform content asserts.
    
    @param sourceId - The id of a fixture to use (only relevant for internal tests).
