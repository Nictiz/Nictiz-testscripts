# Nictiz Generate TestScripts

This folder contains source files for generating TestScripts from NTS-files.

The NTS-files and resources referenced are placed per 'project' (information standard and version) in `src/[projectname]`. Files that contain materials (for example asserts) that span multiple projects are placed in `src/common-asserts`.

The TestScript can be generated by running the `build.xml` ANT-build or (on Windows) by execuiting `build.bat`. When asked, fill in the relevant projectname or pass it as a parameter by using `-Dproject=[projectname]`.

For more info on the NTS-syntax, please see [the NTS readme](https://github.com/Nictiz/Nictiz-tooling-testscripts/tree/main/generate). The repository referenced is also where the build sources its tooling materials.

The output is placed in the `build/[projectname]` folder and is not committed to the repository at this location. Please check and copy the output to it's intended location by hand. If you are absolutely certain that a build can be copied, the ANT `-Dbuild.dir` property can be set. At this location, a `[projectname]` folder with the output in it will still be created. Note that `${build.dir}/[projectname]` is deleted before creating new output, please make sure there are only generated TestScripts in this directory.
